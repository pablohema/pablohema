# Hola gente 👋
<img align="right" width="150" height="170" src="assets/AndroidHello.gif">
Nice to meet you. My name is Pablo. I am a mechanical design engineer. Computer programming is one of my biggest hobbies (the others being 3D CAD 📐, learning new cultures and meeting friends).

Currently I am very interested in Android development (both the technical aspect and the design aspect). My goal is to be able to enjoy and develop my own Android apps while I step up in the game . 

If you do not mind, I will use this *README* to write down all my journey.
